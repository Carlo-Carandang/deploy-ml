# deploy-ml
This open source library is essentually a wrapper for popular machine learning libraries. It streamlines, and simplifies the training and deployment of algrithms. Right now the library is in its infancy. We are working to get the core functionality up and running in order to be tested at Imperial College London. 

## Getting Involved
As this is still a very new project, we have enabled bug reporting and feature requesting. Also if you're good at python or doing research please let us know and get involved in the development. 

## Dependancies 
Modules are activated seperately meaning that you don't have to have everything. However, you will have to have the sk-learn library as this is used a lot for the data processing in pretty much all the models. Keras and Tensorflow are only needed if you activate
